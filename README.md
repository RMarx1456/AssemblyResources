# AssemblyResources
Project for SDEV305- will be looking to expand this later on after the project is "finished".

I wanted to do something where I could open an assembly program I wrote, that opens another assembly program, attaches itself to it, pulls the SYSCALL data, then updates the DB with it, but I don't have enough time to, and I'm already sleep deprived while working on it, so that isn't great either.

HOW THIS WORKS:
The home endpoint allows you to input SYSCALLS into the MariaDB database.
You can view a list of all the SYSCALLS through the /SYSCALLS endpoint.
The confirm endpoint shows you what you input into the MariaDB database.
